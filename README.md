# EDA_Work
Just some exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and transformation work I have been doing.

# Importing data
The notebooks should explain where the data comes from and how to import it. Since I am using Linux and this repository is mainly for storing my EDA code, it'll probably be some CURL command for later usage.
